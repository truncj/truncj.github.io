Purpose: 

<i>Simple</i>... I want "smart" thermostat control for all of my heat

Constraints:

* I live in a home that was built late 60s.
* My heat is hydronic (hot water baseboard)
* I have 6 thermostats for the 6-zones of heat
* There are only two wires that go to each thermostat for heat (red & white)


Other Solutions:

Replace with Nest/Ecobee:
* Expensive: no smart thermostat can handle multiple zones, so I need 1 for each zone (~$200*6 = $1200)
* Difficult: I would need to re-run thermostat wire in the walls (20-100ft each) that <i>might</i> be stapled to the studs

Replace with battery-powered [Sensi Wifi Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/Emerson-Thermostat-Version-Energy-Certified/dp/B01NB1OB0I)
* Batteries last a month or two
* Not HomeKit compatible in battery only mode

Replace with a COTS version (only one kind-of exists..[Honeywell TrueZONE](https://www.supplyhouse.com/Honeywell-HZ432-TrueZONE-HZ432-Panel-11487000))
* Old and poorly supported... released in 2008
* Expensive: $330 for just the controller, but you need a RedLink(?) gateway for a shoddy app to work


My Solution... Build my own!
* Centralized at the Furnace/Boiler 
* Re-use the existing in-wall thermostat wires
* HomeKit compatible
* anddddd.. fun? Yeah, fun.. I think
